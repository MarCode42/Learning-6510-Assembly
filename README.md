# Learning-6510-Assembly
Working through the basics of MOS 6510 assembly

This project serves two purposes:
1) learning c64 6510 assembly from https://www.retro-programming.de
2) getting used to working with git and github

This is my first git/github project ever, so it's going to be interesting. I also don't have any experience with 6510 assembly or coding on the C64 in general.

I'm not sure how fast I'll be able to go through all the material, so updates will probably be a bit irregular.
After the tutorial I might do advanced tutorials and/or start a small project of my own.

I'm not working on a real C64 here, although I am probably going to be using one for testing.

The IDE I'm using is C64 Studio (6.7) from here: https://www.georg-rottensteiner.de/en/c64.html#C64_Studio
A comprehensive manual can be found here: https://www.georg-rottensteiner.de/c64/C64Studio/manual/main.html

The emulator is WinVice (3.4), which can be found here: https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/
